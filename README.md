# exfmt ðŸŒ¸

> [report them][issues].

`exfmt` formats [Elixir][elixir] source code according to a standard set of
rules. It is inspired by Aaron VonderHaar's [gofmt][elm-format].

```elixir
# exfmt takes any Elixir code...

defmodule MyApp, do: (
    def run( data ), do: {
      :ok,
      data
   }
)

# and rewrites it in a clean and idiomatic style:

defmodule MyApp do
  def run(data) do
    {:ok, data}
  end
end
```

The benefits of `exfmt`:

 - It makes code **easier to write**, because you never have to worry about
   minor formatting concerns while powering out new code.
 - It makes code **easier to read**, because there are no longer distracting
   minor stylistic differences between different code bases. As such, your
   brain can map more efficiently from source to mental model.
 - It makes code **easier to maintain**, because you can no longer have diffs
   related only to formatting; every diff necessarily involves a material
   change.
 - It **saves your team time** debating how to format things, because there is
   a standard tool that formats everything the same way.
 - It **saves you time** because you don't have to nitpick over formatting
   details of your code.
