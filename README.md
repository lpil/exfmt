# exfmt ðŸŒ¸

`exfmt` formats [Elixir][elixir] source code according to a standard set of
rules. It is inspired by Aaron VonderHaar's [elm-format][elm-format].

```elixir
# exfmt takes any Elixir code...

defmodule MyApp, do: (
    use( SomeLib )
    def run( data ), do: {
      :ok,
      data
   }
)

# and rewrites it in a clean and idiomatic style:

defmodule MyApp do
  use SomeLib

  def run(data) do
    {:ok, data}
  end
end
```

The benefits of `exfmt`:

 - It makes code **easier to write**, because you never have to worry about
   minor formatting concerns while powering out new code.
 - It makes code **easier to read**, because there are no longer distracting
   minor stylistic differences between different code bases. As such, your
   brain can map more efficiently from source to mental model.
 - It makes code **easier to maintain**, because you can no longer have diffs
   related only to formatting; every diff necessarily involves a material
   change.
 - It **saves your team time** debating how to format things, because there is
   a standard tool that formats everything the same way.
 - It **saves you time** because you don't have to nitpick over formatting
   details of your code.

## Usage

To install `exfmt` as a command-line utility, run:

```sh
mix escript.install github lpil/exfmt
```

You can then run exfmt like so: (the default max line width is 80 characters)
```sh
exfmt --max-width 100 file.ex file2.exs
```

which will rewrite the files, formatted. If there is any kind of error in the process, exfmt will
abort and leave your existing files as-is.

You can also include `exfmt` as a mix dependency and use the Elixir API directly.


## Development

`exfmt` is an open project, contributions are very much welcomed. If you have
feedback or have found a bug, please open [an issue][issues]. If you wish to
make a code contribution please open a [pull request][prs], though for larger
code changes it may be good to open an issue first so we can work out the best
way to move forward.
